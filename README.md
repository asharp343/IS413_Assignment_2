# IS413_Assignment_2

DESCRIPTION:
Convert the web app to the MVC model


INSTRUCTIONS:
Convert the Web App you created in Assignment #1 to an MVC structure following the pattern in this week's videos.  Separate your Grade Calculator program into a second view and add navigation to access that page.  Create a model for your Grade Calculation form.

Be sure to include:

The basic jQuery selector ($) to select the elements in your JavaScript program.
Appropriate folders for each element of MVC.
A Controller to access the corresponding Views.
Razor code to set the text in the header.
A shared layout across all pages.
Tag helpers for navigation.
Validation in the model to ensure the user enters a number between 0 and 100 (#notcoveredinthevideos).
As always, write good code (use indentation, commenting, whitespace, descriptive variable names, etc.)

Submit a link to the GitHub Repository containing your project.  Alternatively, you can zip the project folder up and upload that .zip file.
